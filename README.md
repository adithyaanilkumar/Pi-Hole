Are you tired of those pesky ads popping up when watching your favourite videos online or while playing your favourite games?
Want a better internet experience without these ads? Don't worry, Pi-Hole is here to save the day!

In this workshop, you’re going to create a network wide ad blocker that can block ads across all the devices on your local network.  



## What is  Pi Hole?
Pi Hole is a network-wide ad blocker. It disables almost all ads from all devices connected to  your home network, without having to install an ad blocker on every single device. 
Visit the [Official Website](https://pi-hole.net/) to know in detail.

**Pi-hole intercepts requests for advertisements and prevents them from being downloaded**

## How does Pi-Hole work?
In technical terms, Pi hole is a DNS server which prevents the ads from being located.  In order to understand how Pi Hole works, we first need to understand what a DNS server is.

In simple words, a DNS server is is the phonebook of the Internet. It is a server which looks up the internet address registry to help locate a particular website or a page on the internet. For example, When you type domain names such as ‘google.com’ or ‘hackclub.com’ into web browsers, the DNS server is responsible for finding the correct [IP address](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/) for those sites.
